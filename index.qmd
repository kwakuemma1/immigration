What is the expected immigration attitude of someone who is liberal and starts with an attitude of 6? 

```{r}
x <- trains |> 
  select(att_end, liberal, att_start) 
```

```{r}
stan_glm(data = x, 
         formula = att_end ~ liberal + att_start, 
         family = gaussian, 
         refresh = 0,
         seed = 9)
```
